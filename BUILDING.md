# Building

Building gyuanx electron wallet binaries is done using github actions. Windows and linux binaries will build right out of the box but there are some extra steps needed for Mac OS

## Mac OS

The build script for Mac OS requires you to have a valid `Developer ID Application` certificate. Without this the build script cannot sign and notarize the mac binary which is needed for Catalina 10.15 and above.
If you would like to disable this then comment out `"afterSign": "build/notarize.js",` in package.json.

You will also need an [App-specific password](https://support.apple.com/en-al/HT204397) for the apple account you wish to notarize with

### Setup

Once you have your `Developer ID Application` you need to export it into a `.p12` file. Keep a note of the password used to encrypt this file as it will be needed later.

We need to Base64 encode this file, so run the following command:

```
base64 -i certificate.p12 -o encoded.txt
```

    5.  Team ID (Optional)
